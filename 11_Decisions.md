# Decision 001

Date: 2026-07-05

Decision: TASK-000 and TASK-001 for Hotel Engine completed. Confirmed via code search: the Hotel Engine skeleton exists but is empty (14 files + ai/ subfolder, 0-1 bytes each). No legacy hotel/room/villa logic exists anywhere else in the project (models/, api/, app/ — excluding the empty skeleton). No migration is required. Work is proceeding on branch feature/hotel-engine.

Reason: Verify a clean starting point before beginning schema/domain design (TASK-002), per the one-Engine-at-a-time rule in CLAUDE.md.

Approved By: Daler

Status: TASK-001 Status: READY FOR ANALYSIS

---

# Decision 002

Date: 2026-07-05

Decision: Hotel Contacts (domain doc #15) and Hotel Documents (domain doc #22) are deferred out of the initial Hotel Engine TASK-002 schema. They are not part of the current room/availability model but are logged here as a candidate for a later task so they are not forgotten when work moves to the next Engine.

Reason: TASK-002 schema scope was deliberately narrowed to physical hotel/room/availability data (per Decision 001 and the Contract Engine boundary). Contacts and Documents are legitimate hotel-profile data but were not requested for this pass.

Approved By: Daler

Status: DEFERRED — candidate for a future Hotel Engine task

---

# Decision 003

Date: 2026-07-05

Decision: Hotel Engine and Contract Engine (and all future business Engines) must emit domain events for every meaningful state change (e.g. hotel_created, hotel_published, room_type_created, contract_created, contract_published, price_changed) — even though Audit & Log Engine doesn't exist yet. This is a forward-looking convention, not something to build fully now: Hotel Engine's events.py file (already in the scaffold) should define these event names/payloads as placeholders now, so Audit & Log Engine can subscribe to them later without requiring changes to Hotel/Contract Engine at that time.

Reason: User requested ability to see change history (who changed what, when) on hotels and contracts. Rather than building audit logging into every engine separately, events.py in each engine is the designated place for this, matching the 22-engine architecture where Audit & Log Engine (#21) is responsible for aggregating history centrally.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Logged as forward-looking architecture decision — no code changes required yet beyond what's already scoped for TASK-002 (events.py placeholder).

---

# Decision 004

Date: 2026-07-05

Decision: AI implementation strategy — do not wait until all 22 Engines are complete before adding AI. Instead: (1) each Engine gets only AI scaffolding (empty ai/ folder, events.py placeholders) during its own build, no real AI code yet; (2) once Hotel, Contract, and Booking Engines are all complete and LOCKED, pause before starting the next Engine to build the first real AI feature — AI-assisted contract PDF parsing (Contract Engine, Level 2 autonomy per AI Autonomy Levels: AI extracts data, shows it next to the source PDF for manager review, manager approves before publish); (3) after that AI feature is proven working, continue with the remaining Engines one at a time, adding real AI features engine-by-engine as each one's business logic is ready to support it.

Reason: Waiting until all 22 Engines are done before testing any AI functionality would delay validating whether the Advisor/Gate/Autonomous pattern actually works in practice. Testing AI early on a real, contained use case (contract parsing) gives faster, more meaningful feedback than building 15+ more Engines blind.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Logged as project roadmap decision. Current focus remains Hotel Engine (one-engine-at-a-time rule unaffected) — this only defines WHEN to pause for AI work, not a change to current priorities.

---

# Decision 005

Date: 2026-07-06

Decision: Event constants must only be defined within their owning Engine's events.py, discovered when hotel/events.py was about to incorrectly include Contract Engine's contract_created/contract_published/price_changed events. Going forward: cross-engine event lists must be split by ownership before implementation, never defined speculatively in another Engine's file, even as placeholders.

Reason: Decision 003 named Hotel and Contract Engine events together as one architectural pattern (domain events for Audit & Log Engine to subscribe to later), which led to briefly scoping all 7 example event names into Hotel Engine's events.py. Caught before implementation — Contract Engine hasn't started its own lifecycle yet, and defining its events elsewhere would violate the one-Engine-at-a-time rule.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Logged as a standing convention for all future Engine events.py work.

---

# Decision 006

Date: 2026-07-06

Decision: Hotel Engine's api.py duplicates JWT-decode logic locally (get_current_user) rather than importing a shared dependency, because Authentication Engine's api.py never exposed one and Authentication Engine is LOCKED. This duplication will repeat in every future Engine's api.py until Authentication Engine is revisited via a deliberate follow-up task to extract a shared, importable auth dependency.

Reason: 06_API_Rules.md requires every API to be authenticated except Login, but no reusable get_current_user dependency exists anywhere in the codebase to import. Authentication Engine's own api.py only inlines JWT-decode logic inside its change-password endpoint, and per CLAUDE.md the engine is LOCKED and should not be modified without a deliberate new task.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Logged as known technical debt — accepted for now, to be resolved by a dedicated future task extracting a shared auth dependency.

---

# Decision 007

Date: 2026-07-06

Decision: Hotel Engine is backend-only for now. No frontend UI (add-hotel form, availability calendar, etc.) will be built before Hotel Engine is LOCKED. Frontend work is deferred to a later task, likely alongside Booking Engine, once it's clearer how an agent actually needs to interact with this data end-to-end.

Reason: Building UI now, before Booking Engine exists and before real usage patterns are known, risks designing screens around guesses rather than actual agent workflows. This is a deliberate scoping choice, not an oversight.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Logged so the absence of a Hotel Engine frontend isn't later mistaken for incomplete work.

---

# Decision 008

Date: 2026-07-06

Decision: Payment Engine (not yet started) must support real online card payment from day one of its own build — not just balance/bank-transfer tracking. This is a product requirement, not optional. Additionally, all APIs across every Engine should remain platform-agnostic (already true, since they're REST APIs) to support a future native mobile app as an additional consumer, without requiring backend changes when mobile is built.

Reason: User explicitly requires online payment capability at launch (not a later add-on) and mobile app support in the future roadmap. Logging now, while working on Contract Engine, so this requirement isn't lost or discovered late when Payment Engine's own TASK-000 begins.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Logged as a forward-looking product requirement — no code changes required now (Payment Engine hasn't started its lifecycle yet); to be enforced when Payment Engine's TASK-000 begins.

---

# Decision 009

Date: 2026-07-06

Decision: Two future requirements for Pricing Engine and Finance Engine (neither started yet), logged now while working on Contract Engine so they aren't lost:

1. Pricing Engine must support agent price tiers/categories (not per-individual-agent pricing, but category-based) — e.g. "Good" (trusted partners who don't leak our net rates to competitors, get the lowest markup) and "Standard" (regular agents, standard markup). Each agent is assigned to a category, and the price they see depends on their category's markup rules on top of Contract Engine's net rate.

2. Finance Engine must support recording deliberate below-cost sales with a linked hotel cash-back arrangement — e.g. a specific booking is sold to an agent below net cost as a business decision, but the hotel separately compensates the company with a rebate (e.g. 5% of total sales) once a cumulative volume threshold is reached (e.g. $1M in sales). This is NOT an automated formula — per the project owner, these arrangements are negotiated per-hotel and recorded manually as they're agreed, not calculated automatically by a fixed rule. Finance Engine needs a way to record and track these individual arrangements and their fulfillment, not a generic automatic cashback calculator.

Reason: User identified two real pricing/finance mechanisms used in the actual business that aren't yet reflected in any Engine's design: agent-tier-based pricing, and negotiated hotel cashback on cumulative volume (independent of per-booking margin). Logging now to ensure these aren't missed when Pricing Engine and Finance Engine begin their own TASK-000.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Logged as forward-looking product requirements. No code changes now — Contract Engine work continues uninterrupted.

---

# Decision 010

Date: 2026-07-06

Decision: Contract Engine's service.py directly imports and calls Hotel Engine's service.py functions (app.engines.hotel.service) to validate hotel_id/room_type_id existence. This creates a real dependency: if Hotel Engine's service.py signatures ever change, Contract Engine could break silently with no automated check catching it. Accepted as a known architectural risk for now, since there's no test suite anywhere in the project to catch this kind of regression either way — but flagged explicitly so a future Booking Engine (which will depend on both) doesn't introduce a third silent link in this chain without someone noticing the pattern.

Reason: Identified while reviewing Contract Engine's cross-engine wiring — this is the first Engine-to-Engine code dependency in the codebase (previously only documented via the Interface Contract convention, not yet exercised in real code). Worth recording explicitly as a pattern to watch, not just an implementation detail.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Logged as a known architectural risk. No code change now — revisit if Booking Engine's own dependency wiring reveals this needs a firmer contract (e.g. integration tests spanning Engine boundaries).

---

# Decision 011

Date: 2026-07-06

Decision: Contract Engine (LOCKED) is extended with two new functions, reserve_allotment(db, contract_id, room_type_id, check_in, check_out) and release_allotment(db, contract_id, room_type_id, check_in, check_out), added to service.py, api.py, and docs/interface-contracts/contract-hotel-booking.md. This is a purely additive change — no existing function signature, model, schema, or endpoint was modified. Existing Contract Engine functionality was re-verified after the addition (syntax check, real import check, and a functional test of the new functions against real allotment data) before returning to Booking Engine's own TASK-002.

Reason: Booking Engine's TASK-002 domain model design identified that 02_Logic_Rules.md #51 ("inventory decreases automatically" on booking, "returns automatically" on cancellation) had no corresponding function anywhere — Contract Engine's original 6 Interface Contract functions were all reads. This is exactly the scenario Decision 010 anticipated: a future Engine's cross-engine wiring revealing a gap in an already-LOCKED Engine's contract. Extending a LOCKED engine additively (not modifying its existing surface) is treated as distinct from violating the LOCK — the LOCK protects against silent/unreviewed changes to existing behavior, not against deliberate, reviewed, additive extensions driven by a real downstream need.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Implemented. reserve_allotment/release_allotment are live in Contract Engine's service.py and api.py; Interface Contract doc updated to document them. Booking Engine's models.py can now reference real, existing functions rather than planned ones.

---

# Decision 012

Date: 2026-07-06

Decision: Booking Engine's create_booking wraps the repository.create_booking insert in a try/except. If it raises for any reason, the except clause calls Contract Engine's release_allotment (compensating for the reserve_allotment call that already succeeded moments earlier) before re-raising the original exception. This is a best-effort compensating action, not a true distributed transaction.

Reason: create_booking's own docstring already documented that reserve_allotment (a Contract Engine write) happens before the Booking row insert (a Booking Engine write), and that a failure in between would orphan the reservation with no booking to match it. Rather than defer this entirely, a minimal compensating-action safeguard was added to close the most likely failure mode (e.g. a DB constraint violation on insert) without requiring new infrastructure. This does not fully solve the problem: if release_allotment itself fails during the compensation, the reservation remains orphaned. A complete fix would require actual DB-level transaction coordination spanning Hotel/Contract/Booking Engines, which this project has no mechanism for (no distributed transaction manager, no saga orchestration).

Approved By: Daler

Status: Implemented in service.py's create_booking. Logged as a known partial mitigation, not a claim that the underlying cross-engine transaction gap (Decision 011's reasoning) is fully closed.

---

# Decision 013

Date: 2026-07-07

Decision: Frontend work is no longer deferred. Decision 007 deferred Hotel Engine's frontend "likely alongside Booking Engine, once it's clearer how an agent needs to interact with this data end-to-end" — that condition is now met: Booking Engine (TASK-002) is complete and end-to-end verified across Hotel, Contract, and Booking Engines together. Real frontend work begins now, starting with the agent-facing hotel search + room selection + booking flow, backed by the real Hotel/Contract/Booking Engine APIs instead of AgentDashboard_v2's demo data. This becomes the next major workstream after Booking Engine's LOCK.

Reason: Decision 007's deferral was conditional, not indefinite — it was waiting specifically for enough of the booking flow to exist that real agent usage patterns could inform the UI design, rather than guessing. That condition is satisfied now.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Logged as superseding Decision 007's deferral for Hotel, Contract, and Booking Engine frontends alike. Next workstream, not yet started.

---

# Decision 014

Date: 2026-07-07

Decision: Port 8000 has an orphaned/phantom socket listener (PID 15248) with no identifiable owning process, unkillable via standard Windows tools, serving stale pre-Hotel/Contract/Booking-Engine code. Port 8001 is adopted as the standard dev backend port going forward. A reboot might clear the phantom socket, but rather than pause work for that, we're standardizing on 8001.

Reason: Confirmed via netstat/Get-NetTCPConnection that PID 15248 has held port 8000 LISTENING since 2026-07-04, answering HTTP 200 with an OpenAPI schema missing the hotel-engine/contract-engine/booking-engine routers — yet tasklist, Get-Process, and wmic all report no such process exists. This blocks frontend work (HotelSearch.tsx) from reliably using port 8000. Port 8001 was confirmed live and serving the current backend (booking-engine routes present in its OpenAPI schema).

Approved By: Daler

Status: Implemented. config.ts, CLAUDE.md's documented dev commands, and AgentRegistration.tsx's hardcoded API host (which bypassed config.ts entirely) were all updated to use port 8001.

---

# Decision 015

Date: 2026-07-07

Decision: Contract Engine's get_room_price (LOCKED) and, transitively, Booking
Engine's create_booking (LOCKED) never validated adults+children against Hotel
Engine's RoomType.max_occupancy — confirmed by tracing the full call chain
during Booking Engine frontend testing (adults=2 + children=2 = 4 was priced
and would have been bookable against a room type with max_occupancy=3, no
error). Fixed by adding a new validate_capacity(db, room_type_id, adults,
children) function to Hotel Engine's service.py — a thin wrapper around the
already-existing validate_occupancy_within_capacity validator, exposed
through Hotel Engine's service boundary — and calling it from Contract
Engine's get_room_price right after the existing adults<1 guard. Because
Booking Engine's create_booking already calls get_room_price internally
before reserve_allotment, this single insertion point closes the gap for
both the standalone price-check endpoint and actual booking creation, with
no changes needed in booking/service.py itself. Infants remain excluded from
the check, consistent with validate_occupancy_within_capacity's existing
documented rule.

Reason: Discovered via live frontend testing of HotelSearch.tsx (Decision
013's frontend workstream) — increasing guest count beyond a room's
max_occupancy was silently priced with no error, which would let an agent
create an invalid overbooked reservation. This is the same category of gap
Decision 010 anticipated (a downstream Engine's real usage revealing a hole
in an already-LOCKED Engine's contract) and the same additive-extension
pattern as Decision 011 (reserve_allotment/release_allotment): a purely
additive fix to a LOCKED engine's service surface, consumed by another
LOCKED engine, re-verified for regressions before considered done.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Implemented and re-verified. Direct get_room_price calls: baseline
(2 adults, 0 children, 6 nights) still returns exactly 540.0 (no
regression); at-capacity boundary (2 adults + 1 child = 3, max_occupancy=3)
still succeeds (648.0, no false rejection); over-capacity (adults=10)
correctly raises ValueError ("Occupancy combination (10 adults + 0 children
= 10) exceeds room type 'Beach Villa' max_occupancy of 3"). Also verified
via a real create_booking call with adults=10 against an available night
(check_allotment would otherwise pass) — raises the same ValueError with
zero DB side effects (no allotment reserved, no Booking row inserted,
confirmed by rollback + row-count check).

---

# Decision 016

Date: 2026-07-07

Decision: get_room_price only implements "age_category_price" and
"meal_plan_supplement" RateSupplement adjustment types. "extra_bed",
"single_occupancy", and "extra_person" exist only as a code comment
(models.py:126-128) and in the governing docs (02_Logic_Rules.md #738-741,
03_Domain_Model.md #919-925) but have zero implementation — any contract
configured with these adjustment types would have them silently ignored.
This requires project-owner business rule decisions before implementation
(e.g., does single_occupancy apply whenever adults=1 regardless of room
type, or only specific room types? Is extra_bed a fixed per-stay charge or
per-night? Does extra_person differ from age_category_price for adults, or
supersede it?) — not something to invent now. Flagging as a real, documented
gap, separate from the capacity-check bug.

Reason: Discovered while investigating why adults=10 and adults=1 returned
identical prices during Booking Engine frontend testing. Traced to two
separate causes: (1) this test contract has no "Adult" ContractAgeCategory
or matching RateSupplement row, a test-data gap, not a code bug, since
get_room_price's existing age_category_price bucket logic is generic and
would charge per adult if that data existed (same mechanism already
correctly charging per child); and (2) get_room_price never queries
"extra_bed"/"single_occupancy"/"extra_person" adjustment types at all, which
is the real code gap logged here.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Logged as known unimplemented pricing dimension, to be scoped in a
dedicated future task.

---

# Decision 017

Date: 2026-07-07

Decision: Added Rate.base_occupancy (Integer, nullable=False, default=2) to
Contract Engine's Rate model — how many adults base_price already includes
(e.g. "based on 2" in a real hotel contract), distinct from Hotel Engine's
RoomType.max_occupancy, which is a physical capacity ceiling, not a pricing
inclusion count. Implemented the "extra_person" RateSupplement adjustment
type in get_room_price (one of Decision 016's three unimplemented types):
adults beyond rate.base_occupancy are charged per the extra_person
supplement's calculation_basis, added to supplements_total alongside (not
replacing) the existing age_category_price mechanism. Scoped to adults only
— no equivalent "extra child" rule has been confirmed against a real
contract, so this is not extended to children/infants. "extra_bed" and
"single_occupancy" remain unimplemented; Decision 016's gap for those two
stays open pending project-owner business rules.

Reason: Modeled directly on the real Kandima Maldives contract (Sunrise
Beach Villa: base_price $2,390/night at base_occupancy=2, extra_person
supplement $190/night per adult beyond that) — a concrete real-world case
that needed base_occupancy-aware pricing, giving a bounded, verifiable slice
of Decision 016's gap to implement now rather than waiting on all three
adjustment types' business rules at once.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Implemented and verified end-to-end via real HTTP calls against
contract-engine's /contracts/{id}/room-types/{id}/price endpoint, using
persistent Kandima Maldives / Sunrise Beach Villa test data (hotel, room
type, contract, Peak season, rate, extra_person RateSupplement — created via
direct SQLite writes in a prior session; no migration file or seed script
exists for it, consistent with this project having no migration tooling and
dmc.db being gitignored). adults=3, children=0, infants=0, 1 night,
meal_plan=BB -> final_total=2580.0 exactly (2390 base + 190 extra_person for
the 1 adult over base_occupancy). Regression-checked against the
pre-existing Test Beach Resort contract (2 adults, 6 nights, Early Bird 10%)
-> still returns exactly 540.0, confirming the base_occupancy migration and
new extra_person code path introduced no regression to existing pricing
paths.

# Decision 018

Date: 2026-07-07

Decision: Changed get_active_contract's date-matching rule from "today's
real-world date" to "the requested check-in date." Signature is now
get_active_contract(db, hotel_id, check_in_date=None), checking
contract_status == "Active" AND start_date <= check_in_date <= end_date.
check_in_date defaults to today only for backward compatibility with any
caller that omits it; every real call site now passes the actual check-in
date being searched or booked, not the default. This is a behavior change to
an existing LOCKED function's comparison basis, not a purely additive
extension like Decisions 011/015/017 — full blast radius (3 call sites) was
reviewed and the exact diff approved before implementation:
- Contract Engine's api.py: GET /hotels/{hotel_id}/active-contract now takes
  a required check_in query parameter.
- Booking Engine's create_booking: passes data.arrival_date (already
  validated in scope one line earlier) instead of relying on the default.
- HotelSearch.tsx: passes its checkIn form state (already used identically
  for the /price call later in the same function) as a check_in query
  param.
docs/interface-contracts/contract-hotel-booking.md's get_active_contract
entry updated to match.

Reason: An agent searching for a future stay should see pricing from any
contract whose date range covers that future check-in date, regardless of
whether the contract has technically "started" as of today's real-world
date. Discovered as a real gap via the Kandima Maldives contract (starts
2027-01-11): get_active_contract(hotel_id=2) returned None as of today
(2026-07-07) even though the contract, season, and rate are all fully
configured and correct for a stay in that future window — the only
verification workaround available was bypassing get_active_contract
entirely and calling get_room_price directly by contract_id, which isn't
how a real agent search would reach it.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Implemented and verified. Regression: get_active_contract(hotel_id=1,
check_in=2026-07-10) still resolves to Test Contract 2026 (id=1), unchanged
from before -- Test Contract 2026's 2026-01-01..2026-12-31 window contains
both today and every check-in date used in prior tests, so the old and new
comparison bases coincide for this contract. New behavior:
get_active_contract(hotel_id=2, check_in=2027-02-01), a date inside
Kandima's real Peak season, now resolves directly to Kandima Maldives
Contract 2027 (id=2) with no bypass needed. Sanity check:
get_active_contract(hotel_id=2, check_in=2026-07-07 i.e. today) still
correctly returns null, confirming the fix is scoped to the requested
check-in date, not "always active" once a contract exists.
