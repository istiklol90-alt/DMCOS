# Decision 001

Date: 2026-07-05

Decision: TASK-000 and TASK-001 for Hotel Engine completed. Confirmed via code search: the Hotel Engine skeleton exists but is empty (14 files + ai/ subfolder, 0-1 bytes each). No legacy hotel/room/villa logic exists anywhere else in the project (models/, api/, app/ — excluding the empty skeleton). No migration is required. Work is proceeding on branch feature/hotel-engine.

Reason: Verify a clean starting point before beginning schema/domain design (TASK-002), per the one-Engine-at-a-time rule in CLAUDE.md.

Approved By: Daler

Status: TASK-001 Status: READY FOR ANALYSIS

---

# Decision 002

Date: 2026-07-05

Decision: Hotel Contacts (domain doc #15) and Hotel Documents (domain doc #22) are deferred out of the initial Hotel Engine TASK-002 schema. They are not part of the current room/availability model but are logged here as a candidate for a later task so they are not forgotten when work moves to the next Engine.

Reason: TASK-002 schema scope was deliberately narrowed to physical hotel/room/availability data (per Decision 001 and the Contract Engine boundary). Contacts and Documents are legitimate hotel-profile data but were not requested for this pass.

Approved By: Daler

Status: DEFERRED — candidate for a future Hotel Engine task

---

# Decision 003

Date: 2026-07-05

Decision: Hotel Engine and Contract Engine (and all future business Engines) must emit domain events for every meaningful state change (e.g. hotel_created, hotel_published, room_type_created, contract_created, contract_published, price_changed) — even though Audit & Log Engine doesn't exist yet. This is a forward-looking convention, not something to build fully now: Hotel Engine's events.py file (already in the scaffold) should define these event names/payloads as placeholders now, so Audit & Log Engine can subscribe to them later without requiring changes to Hotel/Contract Engine at that time.

Reason: User requested ability to see change history (who changed what, when) on hotels and contracts. Rather than building audit logging into every engine separately, events.py in each engine is the designated place for this, matching the 22-engine architecture where Audit & Log Engine (#21) is responsible for aggregating history centrally.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Logged as forward-looking architecture decision — no code changes required yet beyond what's already scoped for TASK-002 (events.py placeholder).

---

# Decision 004

Date: 2026-07-05

Decision: AI implementation strategy — do not wait until all 22 Engines are complete before adding AI. Instead: (1) each Engine gets only AI scaffolding (empty ai/ folder, events.py placeholders) during its own build, no real AI code yet; (2) once Hotel, Contract, and Booking Engines are all complete and LOCKED, pause before starting the next Engine to build the first real AI feature — AI-assisted contract PDF parsing (Contract Engine, Level 2 autonomy per AI Autonomy Levels: AI extracts data, shows it next to the source PDF for manager review, manager approves before publish); (3) after that AI feature is proven working, continue with the remaining Engines one at a time, adding real AI features engine-by-engine as each one's business logic is ready to support it.

Reason: Waiting until all 22 Engines are done before testing any AI functionality would delay validating whether the Advisor/Gate/Autonomous pattern actually works in practice. Testing AI early on a real, contained use case (contract parsing) gives faster, more meaningful feedback than building 15+ more Engines blind.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Logged as project roadmap decision. Current focus remains Hotel Engine (one-engine-at-a-time rule unaffected) — this only defines WHEN to pause for AI work, not a change to current priorities.

---

# Decision 005

Date: 2026-07-06

Decision: Event constants must only be defined within their owning Engine's events.py, discovered when hotel/events.py was about to incorrectly include Contract Engine's contract_created/contract_published/price_changed events. Going forward: cross-engine event lists must be split by ownership before implementation, never defined speculatively in another Engine's file, even as placeholders.

Reason: Decision 003 named Hotel and Contract Engine events together as one architectural pattern (domain events for Audit & Log Engine to subscribe to later), which led to briefly scoping all 7 example event names into Hotel Engine's events.py. Caught before implementation — Contract Engine hasn't started its own lifecycle yet, and defining its events elsewhere would violate the one-Engine-at-a-time rule.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Logged as a standing convention for all future Engine events.py work.

---

# Decision 006

Date: 2026-07-06

Decision: Hotel Engine's api.py duplicates JWT-decode logic locally (get_current_user) rather than importing a shared dependency, because Authentication Engine's api.py never exposed one and Authentication Engine is LOCKED. This duplication will repeat in every future Engine's api.py until Authentication Engine is revisited via a deliberate follow-up task to extract a shared, importable auth dependency.

Reason: 06_API_Rules.md requires every API to be authenticated except Login, but no reusable get_current_user dependency exists anywhere in the codebase to import. Authentication Engine's own api.py only inlines JWT-decode logic inside its change-password endpoint, and per CLAUDE.md the engine is LOCKED and should not be modified without a deliberate new task.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Logged as known technical debt — accepted for now, to be resolved by a dedicated future task extracting a shared auth dependency.

---

# Decision 007

Date: 2026-07-06

Decision: Hotel Engine is backend-only for now. No frontend UI (add-hotel form, availability calendar, etc.) will be built before Hotel Engine is LOCKED. Frontend work is deferred to a later task, likely alongside Booking Engine, once it's clearer how an agent actually needs to interact with this data end-to-end.

Reason: Building UI now, before Booking Engine exists and before real usage patterns are known, risks designing screens around guesses rather than actual agent workflows. This is a deliberate scoping choice, not an oversight.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Logged so the absence of a Hotel Engine frontend isn't later mistaken for incomplete work.

---

# Decision 008

Date: 2026-07-06

Decision: Payment Engine (not yet started) must support real online card payment from day one of its own build — not just balance/bank-transfer tracking. This is a product requirement, not optional. Additionally, all APIs across every Engine should remain platform-agnostic (already true, since they're REST APIs) to support a future native mobile app as an additional consumer, without requiring backend changes when mobile is built.

Reason: User explicitly requires online payment capability at launch (not a later add-on) and mobile app support in the future roadmap. Logging now, while working on Contract Engine, so this requirement isn't lost or discovered late when Payment Engine's own TASK-000 begins.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Logged as a forward-looking product requirement — no code changes required now (Payment Engine hasn't started its lifecycle yet); to be enforced when Payment Engine's TASK-000 begins.

---

# Decision 009

Date: 2026-07-06

Decision: Two future requirements for Pricing Engine and Finance Engine (neither started yet), logged now while working on Contract Engine so they aren't lost:

1. Pricing Engine must support agent price tiers/categories (not per-individual-agent pricing, but category-based) — e.g. "Good" (trusted partners who don't leak our net rates to competitors, get the lowest markup) and "Standard" (regular agents, standard markup). Each agent is assigned to a category, and the price they see depends on their category's markup rules on top of Contract Engine's net rate.

2. Finance Engine must support recording deliberate below-cost sales with a linked hotel cash-back arrangement — e.g. a specific booking is sold to an agent below net cost as a business decision, but the hotel separately compensates the company with a rebate (e.g. 5% of total sales) once a cumulative volume threshold is reached (e.g. $1M in sales). This is NOT an automated formula — per the project owner, these arrangements are negotiated per-hotel and recorded manually as they're agreed, not calculated automatically by a fixed rule. Finance Engine needs a way to record and track these individual arrangements and their fulfillment, not a generic automatic cashback calculator.

Reason: User identified two real pricing/finance mechanisms used in the actual business that aren't yet reflected in any Engine's design: agent-tier-based pricing, and negotiated hotel cashback on cumulative volume (independent of per-booking margin). Logging now to ensure these aren't missed when Pricing Engine and Finance Engine begin their own TASK-000.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Logged as forward-looking product requirements. No code changes now — Contract Engine work continues uninterrupted.

---

# Decision 010

Date: 2026-07-06

Decision: Contract Engine's service.py directly imports and calls Hotel Engine's service.py functions (app.engines.hotel.service) to validate hotel_id/room_type_id existence. This creates a real dependency: if Hotel Engine's service.py signatures ever change, Contract Engine could break silently with no automated check catching it. Accepted as a known architectural risk for now, since there's no test suite anywhere in the project to catch this kind of regression either way — but flagged explicitly so a future Booking Engine (which will depend on both) doesn't introduce a third silent link in this chain without someone noticing the pattern.

Reason: Identified while reviewing Contract Engine's cross-engine wiring — this is the first Engine-to-Engine code dependency in the codebase (previously only documented via the Interface Contract convention, not yet exercised in real code). Worth recording explicitly as a pattern to watch, not just an implementation detail.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Logged as a known architectural risk. No code change now — revisit if Booking Engine's own dependency wiring reveals this needs a firmer contract (e.g. integration tests spanning Engine boundaries).

---

# Decision 011

Date: 2026-07-06

Decision: Contract Engine (LOCKED) is extended with two new functions, reserve_allotment(db, contract_id, room_type_id, check_in, check_out) and release_allotment(db, contract_id, room_type_id, check_in, check_out), added to service.py, api.py, and docs/interface-contracts/contract-hotel-booking.md. This is a purely additive change — no existing function signature, model, schema, or endpoint was modified. Existing Contract Engine functionality was re-verified after the addition (syntax check, real import check, and a functional test of the new functions against real allotment data) before returning to Booking Engine's own TASK-002.

Reason: Booking Engine's TASK-002 domain model design identified that 02_Logic_Rules.md #51 ("inventory decreases automatically" on booking, "returns automatically" on cancellation) had no corresponding function anywhere — Contract Engine's original 6 Interface Contract functions were all reads. This is exactly the scenario Decision 010 anticipated: a future Engine's cross-engine wiring revealing a gap in an already-LOCKED Engine's contract. Extending a LOCKED engine additively (not modifying its existing surface) is treated as distinct from violating the LOCK — the LOCK protects against silent/unreviewed changes to existing behavior, not against deliberate, reviewed, additive extensions driven by a real downstream need.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Implemented. reserve_allotment/release_allotment are live in Contract Engine's service.py and api.py; Interface Contract doc updated to document them. Booking Engine's models.py can now reference real, existing functions rather than planned ones.

---

# Decision 012

Date: 2026-07-06

Decision: Booking Engine's create_booking wraps the repository.create_booking insert in a try/except. If it raises for any reason, the except clause calls Contract Engine's release_allotment (compensating for the reserve_allotment call that already succeeded moments earlier) before re-raising the original exception. This is a best-effort compensating action, not a true distributed transaction.

Reason: create_booking's own docstring already documented that reserve_allotment (a Contract Engine write) happens before the Booking row insert (a Booking Engine write), and that a failure in between would orphan the reservation with no booking to match it. Rather than defer this entirely, a minimal compensating-action safeguard was added to close the most likely failure mode (e.g. a DB constraint violation on insert) without requiring new infrastructure. This does not fully solve the problem: if release_allotment itself fails during the compensation, the reservation remains orphaned. A complete fix would require actual DB-level transaction coordination spanning Hotel/Contract/Booking Engines, which this project has no mechanism for (no distributed transaction manager, no saga orchestration).

Approved By: Daler

Status: Implemented in service.py's create_booking. Logged as a known partial mitigation, not a claim that the underlying cross-engine transaction gap (Decision 011's reasoning) is fully closed.

---

# Decision 013

Date: 2026-07-07

Decision: Frontend work is no longer deferred. Decision 007 deferred Hotel Engine's frontend "likely alongside Booking Engine, once it's clearer how an agent needs to interact with this data end-to-end" — that condition is now met: Booking Engine (TASK-002) is complete and end-to-end verified across Hotel, Contract, and Booking Engines together. Real frontend work begins now, starting with the agent-facing hotel search + room selection + booking flow, backed by the real Hotel/Contract/Booking Engine APIs instead of AgentDashboard_v2's demo data. This becomes the next major workstream after Booking Engine's LOCK.

Reason: Decision 007's deferral was conditional, not indefinite — it was waiting specifically for enough of the booking flow to exist that real agent usage patterns could inform the UI design, rather than guessing. That condition is satisfied now.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Logged as superseding Decision 007's deferral for Hotel, Contract, and Booking Engine frontends alike. Next workstream, not yet started.

---

# Decision 014

Date: 2026-07-07

Decision: Port 8000 has an orphaned/phantom socket listener (PID 15248) with no identifiable owning process, unkillable via standard Windows tools, serving stale pre-Hotel/Contract/Booking-Engine code. Port 8001 is adopted as the standard dev backend port going forward. A reboot might clear the phantom socket, but rather than pause work for that, we're standardizing on 8001.

Reason: Confirmed via netstat/Get-NetTCPConnection that PID 15248 has held port 8000 LISTENING since 2026-07-04, answering HTTP 200 with an OpenAPI schema missing the hotel-engine/contract-engine/booking-engine routers — yet tasklist, Get-Process, and wmic all report no such process exists. This blocks frontend work (HotelSearch.tsx) from reliably using port 8000. Port 8001 was confirmed live and serving the current backend (booking-engine routes present in its OpenAPI schema).

Approved By: Daler

Status: Implemented. config.ts, CLAUDE.md's documented dev commands, and AgentRegistration.tsx's hardcoded API host (which bypassed config.ts entirely) were all updated to use port 8001.

---

# Decision 015

Date: 2026-07-07

Decision: Contract Engine's get_room_price (LOCKED) and, transitively, Booking
Engine's create_booking (LOCKED) never validated adults+children against Hotel
Engine's RoomType.max_occupancy — confirmed by tracing the full call chain
during Booking Engine frontend testing (adults=2 + children=2 = 4 was priced
and would have been bookable against a room type with max_occupancy=3, no
error). Fixed by adding a new validate_capacity(db, room_type_id, adults,
children) function to Hotel Engine's service.py — a thin wrapper around the
already-existing validate_occupancy_within_capacity validator, exposed
through Hotel Engine's service boundary — and calling it from Contract
Engine's get_room_price right after the existing adults<1 guard. Because
Booking Engine's create_booking already calls get_room_price internally
before reserve_allotment, this single insertion point closes the gap for
both the standalone price-check endpoint and actual booking creation, with
no changes needed in booking/service.py itself. Infants remain excluded from
the check, consistent with validate_occupancy_within_capacity's existing
documented rule.

Reason: Discovered via live frontend testing of HotelSearch.tsx (Decision
013's frontend workstream) — increasing guest count beyond a room's
max_occupancy was silently priced with no error, which would let an agent
create an invalid overbooked reservation. This is the same category of gap
Decision 010 anticipated (a downstream Engine's real usage revealing a hole
in an already-LOCKED Engine's contract) and the same additive-extension
pattern as Decision 011 (reserve_allotment/release_allotment): a purely
additive fix to a LOCKED engine's service surface, consumed by another
LOCKED engine, re-verified for regressions before considered done.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Implemented and re-verified. Direct get_room_price calls: baseline
(2 adults, 0 children, 6 nights) still returns exactly 540.0 (no
regression); at-capacity boundary (2 adults + 1 child = 3, max_occupancy=3)
still succeeds (648.0, no false rejection); over-capacity (adults=10)
correctly raises ValueError ("Occupancy combination (10 adults + 0 children
= 10) exceeds room type 'Beach Villa' max_occupancy of 3"). Also verified
via a real create_booking call with adults=10 against an available night
(check_allotment would otherwise pass) — raises the same ValueError with
zero DB side effects (no allotment reserved, no Booking row inserted,
confirmed by rollback + row-count check).

---

# Decision 016

Date: 2026-07-07

Decision: get_room_price only implements "age_category_price" and
"meal_plan_supplement" RateSupplement adjustment types. "extra_bed",
"single_occupancy", and "extra_person" exist only as a code comment
(models.py:126-128) and in the governing docs (02_Logic_Rules.md #738-741,
03_Domain_Model.md #919-925) but have zero implementation — any contract
configured with these adjustment types would have them silently ignored.
This requires project-owner business rule decisions before implementation
(e.g., does single_occupancy apply whenever adults=1 regardless of room
type, or only specific room types? Is extra_bed a fixed per-stay charge or
per-night? Does extra_person differ from age_category_price for adults, or
supersede it?) — not something to invent now. Flagging as a real, documented
gap, separate from the capacity-check bug.

Reason: Discovered while investigating why adults=10 and adults=1 returned
identical prices during Booking Engine frontend testing. Traced to two
separate causes: (1) this test contract has no "Adult" ContractAgeCategory
or matching RateSupplement row, a test-data gap, not a code bug, since
get_room_price's existing age_category_price bucket logic is generic and
would charge per adult if that data existed (same mechanism already
correctly charging per child); and (2) get_room_price never queries
"extra_bed"/"single_occupancy"/"extra_person" adjustment types at all, which
is the real code gap logged here.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Logged as known unimplemented pricing dimension, to be scoped in a
dedicated future task.

---

# Decision 017

Date: 2026-07-07

Decision: Added Rate.base_occupancy (Integer, nullable=False, default=2) to
Contract Engine's Rate model — how many adults base_price already includes
(e.g. "based on 2" in a real hotel contract), distinct from Hotel Engine's
RoomType.max_occupancy, which is a physical capacity ceiling, not a pricing
inclusion count. Implemented the "extra_person" RateSupplement adjustment
type in get_room_price (one of Decision 016's three unimplemented types):
adults beyond rate.base_occupancy are charged per the extra_person
supplement's calculation_basis, added to supplements_total alongside (not
replacing) the existing age_category_price mechanism. Scoped to adults only
— no equivalent "extra child" rule has been confirmed against a real
contract, so this is not extended to children/infants. "extra_bed" and
"single_occupancy" remain unimplemented; Decision 016's gap for those two
stays open pending project-owner business rules.

Reason: Modeled directly on the real Kandima Maldives contract (Sunrise
Beach Pool Villa with Swirlpool: base_price $1,002/night at
base_occupancy=2, extra_person supplement $190/night per adult beyond that)
— a concrete real-world case that needed base_occupancy-aware pricing,
giving a bounded, verifiable slice of Decision 016's gap to implement now
rather than waiting on all three adjustment types' business rules at once.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Implemented and verified end-to-end via real HTTP calls against
contract-engine's /contracts/{id}/room-types/{id}/price endpoint, using
persistent Kandima Maldives / Sunrise Beach Pool Villa with Swirlpool test
data (hotel, room type, contract, Peak season, rate, extra_person
RateSupplement — created via direct SQLite writes in a prior session; no
migration file or seed script exists for it, consistent with this project
having no migration tooling and dmc.db being gitignored). adults=3,
children=0, infants=0, 1 night, meal_plan=BB -> final_total=1192.0 exactly
(1002 base + 190 extra_person for the 1 adult over base_occupancy).
Regression-checked against the pre-existing Test Beach Resort contract (2
adults, 6 nights, Early Bird 10%) -> still returns exactly 540.0, confirming
the base_occupancy migration and new extra_person code path introduced no
regression to existing pricing paths.

Correction (logged 2026-07-07, same day): the room name and Peak rate
originally recorded here ("Sunrise Beach Villa," $2,390 base / $2,580
final_total) were wrong. That room name isn't a real Kandima room type at
all — the persistent test data was mislabeled with a placeholder price that
didn't match the real Kandima PDF. Corrected here to the actual room name
and rate ("Sunrise Beach Pool Villa with Swirlpool," $1,002/night) once the
real contract data was verified against the source PDF. The extra_person
mechanism itself was re-verified against the corrected numbers with the
identical math (base + 190 extra_person), so the code fix this decision
describes remains valid and unaffected — only the test data and the figures
quoted here were wrong, not the pricing logic.

---

# Decision 018

Date: 2026-07-07

Decision: Changed get_active_contract's date-matching rule from "today's
real-world date" to "the requested check-in date." Signature is now
get_active_contract(db, hotel_id, check_in_date=None), checking
contract_status == "Active" AND start_date <= check_in_date <= end_date.
check_in_date defaults to today only for backward compatibility with any
caller that omits it; every real call site now passes the actual check-in
date being searched or booked, not the default. This is a behavior change to
an existing LOCKED function's comparison basis, not a purely additive
extension like Decisions 011/015/017 — full blast radius (3 call sites) was
reviewed and the exact diff approved before implementation:
- Contract Engine's api.py: GET /hotels/{hotel_id}/active-contract now takes
  a required check_in query parameter.
- Booking Engine's create_booking: passes data.arrival_date (already
  validated in scope one line earlier) instead of relying on the default.
- HotelSearch.tsx: passes its checkIn form state (already used identically
  for the /price call later in the same function) as a check_in query
  param.
docs/interface-contracts/contract-hotel-booking.md's get_active_contract
entry updated to match.

Reason: An agent searching for a future stay should see pricing from any
contract whose date range covers that future check-in date, regardless of
whether the contract has technically "started" as of today's real-world
date. Discovered as a real gap via the Kandima Maldives contract (starts
2027-01-11): get_active_contract(hotel_id=2) returned None as of today
(2026-07-07) even though the contract, season, and rate are all fully
configured and correct for a stay in that future window — the only
verification workaround available was bypassing get_active_contract
entirely and calling get_room_price directly by contract_id, which isn't
how a real agent search would reach it.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Implemented and verified. Regression: get_active_contract(hotel_id=1,
check_in=2026-07-10) still resolves to Test Contract 2026 (id=1), unchanged
from before -- Test Contract 2026's 2026-01-01..2026-12-31 window contains
both today and every check-in date used in prior tests, so the old and new
comparison bases coincide for this contract. New behavior:
get_active_contract(hotel_id=2, check_in=2027-02-01), a date inside
Kandima's real Peak season, now resolves directly to Kandima Maldives
Contract 2027 (id=2) with no bypass needed. Sanity check:
get_active_contract(hotel_id=2, check_in=2026-07-07 i.e. today) still
correctly returns null, confirming the fix is scoped to the requested
check-in date, not "always active" once a contract exists.

---

# Decision 019

Date: 2026-07-07

Decision: Real-world discount calculation is more nuanced than currently
implemented: discount % is calculated against the NET room price (before
taxes), then subtracted from the GROSS price (after taxes), BEFORE
meal-plan-upgrade and extra-service supplements are added. Example from
project owner: net BB rate $200, gross (with taxes) $290, 10% discount = $20
off the $200 net base, resulting in $290-$20=$270, THEN meal upgrade/extra-bed
supplements are added on top. This requires: (1) modeling taxes (Green Tax,
service charge, VAT/GST — currently not modeled at all in Contract Engine,
only a single base_price exists), and (2) reordering the discount calculation
to work against net-before-tax rather than base+supplements combined (current
implementation). This is a significant, separate task — not a tweak to
current work — and should not be implemented until scoped properly with the
project owner, since it changes already-tested Contract Engine behavior.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Logged as a significant future task requiring careful scoping —
current discount behavior remains unchanged for now.

---

# Decision 020

Date: 2026-07-07

Decision: Contract Engine's pricing rules (room-type-and-period discount
matrices, meal-plan-specific discounts, occupancy-conditional rules like
"different offer if 1 adult vs 2+ adults", transfer discounts by arrival
date, extra-person supplements, age-category meal pricing) should be
architected as a library of reusable, parameterized "pricing rule formulas"
— not one-off code per hotel. When a new hotel/contract is added, the
manager should be able to SELECT which formulas apply (from an existing
catalog) and fill in the specific numbers/dates/thresholds for that
contract, rather than any new code being written per hotel. Kandima's real
KM26_03 special offer (discovered this session) is the first real-world
case complex enough to require this — it needs at minimum: a
room-type×date-range discount matrix formula, a meal-plan-discount-by-period
formula, an adult-count-conditional family-offer formula, and a
transfer-discount-by-arrival-date formula, and a real hotel WILL reuse a
subset of these same formulas with different numbers.

Reason: Project owner identified that pricing mechanisms (discount
matrices, meal plan rules, occupancy-conditional offers) repeat across
hotels with different specific values but the same underlying shape/logic.
Building each as a reusable formula (vs. hotel-specific code) means every
future hotel with similar contract structures can be onboarded by filling
in data, not writing code — directly serving the AI-first, scalable
architecture goal established early in this project.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Logged as a major future architecture direction for Contract
Engine's pricing rule system. Not to be designed/implemented today — this
is a significant redesign requiring careful scoping (which formulas are
truly common across real contracts vs. hotel-specific edge cases) before
implementation. Immediate next step remains: add Kandima's 9 missing room
types using the existing, already-working pattern.

---

TODO (not a numbered decision — quick note, log properly if/when scoped):
Kandima's real room inventory counts (Sky Studio 56, Beach Studio 72, Beach
Villa with Swirlpool 18, Sunrise Beach Pool Villa with Swirlpool 14, Sunset
Beach Pool Villa with Swirlpool 23, Aqua Villa 30, Aqua Villa with Swirlpool
29, Ocean Pool Villa 18, 2-bedroom Family Sky Suite 8, Sunset Aqua Pool
Suite 2 — from the real PDF) are not modeled anywhere yet. These map to
Contract Engine's `allotments` table, which is day-by-day per room type and
would need explicit rows across the whole contract period
(2027-01-11..2028-01-07) to be real — a separate, larger task from just
adding the room types/rates themselves. Don't forget these real unit counts
exist when that task is eventually scoped.

---

# Decision 021

Date: 2026-07-07

Decision: Contract Engine's get_meal_plans (LOCKED) only returned meal
plans that have a direct Rate row for the requested room type — it never
checked for meal plans reachable only via an active "meal_plan_supplement"
RateSupplement on that room type's base rate, even though get_room_price
has always supported pricing a meal plan that way (a base Rate plus
meal_plan_supplement rows, not just a direct per-meal-plan Rate). Fixed by
adding a second pass in get_meal_plans that collects meal_plan_id from
every active meal_plan_supplement RateSupplement on the room type's rate(s),
unioned with the existing direct-Rate meal_plan_ids. Purely additive — the
direct-Rate half of the logic is unchanged, no existing signature, model,
schema, or endpoint changed. docs/interface-contracts/contract-hotel-
booking.md's get_meal_plans entry updated to match. No caller changes
needed: HotelSearch.tsx's only caller already iterates the returned array
generically, and the response shape (list[ContractMealPlan]) didn't change,
only its contents can now be longer.

Reason: Discovered when Kandima's HB+/FB+/PAI meal plan supplements (added
this session, modeled as meal_plan_supplement RateSupplement rows on top of
the BB direct rate, per the real Kandima PDF) priced correctly via direct
get_room_price calls but never appeared in HotelSearch.tsx's meal-plan rate
table — traced to get_meal_plans silently filtering them out, since it only
implemented the direct-Rate half of the same two-path pricing model
get_room_price already supports. Same category of gap as Decisions
011/015/018: a downstream real usage (the meal-plan rate table UI) revealing
a hole in an already-LOCKED Engine's function that a purely code-level read
never would have caught.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Implemented and verified. get_meal_plans(contract_id=2,
room_type_id=2) via real HTTP call now returns all 4 of Kandima's meal
plans (BB, HB+, FB+, PAI) for Sunrise Beach Pool Villa with Swirlpool,
where it previously returned only BB. Full regression suite re-run and
unchanged: Test Beach Resort (2 adults, 6 nights, Early Bird 10%) ->
540.0; Kandima Sunrise Beach Pool Villa BB (3 adults) -> 1192.0, BB (2
adults + 1 child) -> 1062.0, BB (2 adults) -> 1002.0, HB+ -> 1182.0, FB+
-> 1282.0, PAI -> 1392.0; Sunset Aqua Pool Suite BB -> 1927.0, HB+ ->
2107.0, FB+ -> 2207.0, PAI -> 2317.0 — all exact matches, no regressions
from this fix.

# Decision 022

Date: 2026-07-08

Decision: Added a reusable Transfer module to Contract Engine (LOCKED),
designed as a formula/library any Maldives (or future non-Maldives) hotel
contract can use, not hardcoded to Kandima. New model
ContractTransferOption (contract_transfer_options table): transfer_type
(free-form string, not an enum -- "seaplane", "domestic_comfort",
"domestic_sapphire", etc. -- new transfer kind is new data, never a schema
change, same open-string precedent as RateSupplement.adjustment_type),
transfer_name, price_adult, price_child, price_infant (nullable -- no
infant price exists in the real Kandima data), status. Deliberately not a
RateSupplement row: transfers are a one-time round-trip charge per person,
not RateSupplement's per_person_per_night pattern, so calculation_basis
has no matching option and forcing it in would misrepresent a one-time
charge as recurring. New Contract.transfer_required boolean (single
column on the contract itself, not per-option): refined from an original
per-option is_mandatory proposal after the project owner identified that
was ambiguous (does each option need to be mandatory, or is it "pick one
of the mandatory-flagged ones"?) -- transfer_required=true simply means
"the agent must select exactly one of this contract's available transfer
options," keeping the semantics unambiguous and still correctly handling
a future hotel with a mix of mandatory-baseline and optional-upgrade
transfer options (which a single option-level boolean couldn't express
either way, but a contract-level flag sidesteps entirely by only gating
"is a selection required," not "is this specific option mandatory").

Two new Interface Contract functions, mirroring the get_meal_plans/
get_room_price listing-vs-pricing split: get_transfer_options(db,
contract_id) returns Active options only; get_transfer_price(db,
contract_id, transfer_type, adults, children, infants=0) computes
price_adult * adults + price_child * children + (price_infant or 0) *
infants -- explicitly NOT multiplied by nights. Deliberately kept separate
from get_room_price rather than bundled into its final_total: transfer
price has no relationship to room_type_id, dates, or meal plan, so tying
it to room-type-scoped pricing would be a category error. Migration: this
is a new table (contract_transfer_options), created via
Base.metadata.create_all (additive, no existing table touched) after
adding the model to both init_db.py copies; Contract.transfer_required is
a new column on the already-existing contracts table, which create_all
does NOT retrofit onto a live table (same situation as Decision 017's
base_occupancy), so it required an explicit
`ALTER TABLE contracts ADD COLUMN transfer_required BOOLEAN NOT NULL
DEFAULT 0` against dmc.db directly.

Reason: Real-world requirement -- every Maldives island requires a hotel
transfer, and this needed modeling as a genuinely separate pricing shape
(one-time per-person round-trip, not per-night) rather than forced into
the existing RateSupplement mechanism, plus a reusable, non-hardcoded
schema so any future Maldives (or non-Maldives) hotel contract can define
its own transfer options without a code change.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Implemented and verified end-to-end via real HTTP calls against
the live contract-engine API (not direct function calls) using the real
Kandima contract data from the original PDF's "HOTEL TRANSFER" section:
Domestic Flight Comfort Class ($414/adult, $300/child), Domestic Flight
Sapphire Class ($610/adult, $480/child), Shared Seaplane Transfer
($725/adult, $375/child), transfer_required=true. All 3 created via the
real POST /contract-transfer-options endpoint (not raw SQL). Verified:
GET /contracts/2/transfer-options/available returns all 3; GET
/contracts/2/transfer-price for seaplane (2 adults, 1 child) ->
725*2+375*1=1825.0 exact; for domestic_comfort (2 adults) -> 414*2=828.0
exact; PUT /contracts/2 with {"transfer_required": true} correctly
persists and returns in the ContractResponse. Full regression suite
re-run unchanged: Test Beach Resort 540.0, Kandima BB 1002.0, HB+
1182.0, get_meal_plans still returns all 4 plans, get_active_contract
still resolves correctly with check_in -- no regressions from adding
this module.

Originally deferred, since implemented (2026-07-08, same Decision 022):
Booking Engine integration -- how create_booking consumes
transfer_required/get_transfer_price -- was first proposed and logged
here without implementation (matching the Decision 011 precedent of
adding Contract Engine interface functions before Booking Engine's own
task consumes them), then implemented the same day once approved.

Booking Engine integration: BookingCreate gains transfer_type:
Optional[str] = None. Booking model gains two new nullable columns,
transfer_type and transfer_total -- transfer_total is its own separate
frozen-snapshot column, NOT merged into total_amount, so Finance Engine
can itemize room vs. transfer revenue separately later; total_amount
stays room-only, consistent with how pricing snapshots are already kept
separate elsewhere. create_booking validates contract.transfer_required
against data.transfer_type right after the existing get_active_contract
call (raising ValueError if a selection is required but missing), then
calls get_transfer_price to compute transfer_total when a transfer_type
is given (required or optional), before reserve_allotment -- so an
invalid transfer_type still fails with zero inventory side effects.
Same new-column-on-existing-table situation as Contract.transfer_required:
Booking.transfer_type/transfer_total needed an explicit ALTER TABLE
against the already-existing bookings table, not just
Base.metadata.create_all. Approved by Daler: keep transfer_total
separate from total_amount.

Verified via real HTTP calls against the live booking-engine API:
Kandima (transfer_required=true) booking attempt WITHOUT transfer_type
correctly rejected with "Hotel 2's contract requires selecting a
transfer option," zero side effects. Kandima booking WITH
transfer_type="seaplane" (2 adults) succeeded: total_amount=1002.0
(room-only, unchanged) and transfer_total=1450.0 (725*2) stored as
separate columns, exactly as designed. Test Beach Resort
(transfer_required=false) booking WITHOUT any transfer_type still
succeeds normally (transfer_type/transfer_total both null,
total_amount=90.0 unaffected) -- confirming the optional path is
unchanged for hotels that don't require a transfer. One minimal test
Allotment row was created for Kandima room_type_id=2 (2027-02-01) purely
to unblock this end-to-end verification, since Kandima's real full
inventory counts still aren't modeled (separate, already-logged TODO,
not addressed here).

---

TODO (not a numbered decision -- quick note, log properly if/when
scoped): HotelSearch.tsx's search form collects adults/children/infants
as bucket COUNTS, not individual guest ages, even though real-world
pricing depends on exact age (2-11.99 = child rate, 0-1.99 = infant,
12+ = adult rate). This isn't a new gap introduced by the booking
submission UI (2026-07-08) -- it's the same pre-existing "3-bucket
signature" limitation already documented in
docs/interface-contracts/contract-hotel-booking.md since Contract
Engine's original LOCK: get_room_price/get_transfer_price and every
RateSupplement mechanism (age_category_price, extra_person) all take
adults/children/infants as counts, never per-guest ages, anywhere in
the backend. Confirmed by project owner: keep the search form as-is
(count only) for now rather than scope-creep into redesigning it as
part of the booking flow; the agent is trusted to enter counts
matching the correct age brackets. Revisit only if a dedicated task to
collect exact per-guest ages (e.g. for full multi-guest Guest record
collection, not just the lead guest) is scoped.

# Decision 023

Date: 2026-07-08

Decision: HotelSearch.tsx's frontend age-to-bucket mapping (12+ = adult,
2-11.99 = child, 0-1.99 = infant, per Decision 023's own predecessor TODO)
uses ONE hardcoded set of age boundaries, applied uniformly to room/meal
pricing AND transfer pricing for a given search. This is a deliberate
simplification, not an assumption that real contracts always work this
way: real-world hotel contracts can price the same guest differently
per service -- e.g. a hotel could treat a 14-year-old as a "child" for
room/meal purposes but as an "adult" for transfer purposes, using
different age cutoffs per service, not one universal cutoff per
contract. Kandima's real data happens to use 12+ = adult for both, but
that coincidence isn't a rule to bake in as if it always holds.

A fully correct implementation would fetch each service's own age
boundaries from contract data rather than hardcode them in the
frontend. Checked what's actually possible today: Contract Engine's
get_child_policy(contract_id, room_type_id) already exposes
ContractAgeCategory's real min_age/max_age boundaries for room/meal
pricing, so dynamic fetching is technically feasible there alone. But
ContractTransferOption (Decision 022) has NO age-boundary columns at
all -- only flat price_adult/price_child/price_infant, no min_age/
max_age anywhere. This means a fully dynamic, per-service age-bucketing
system is not achievable today without a Contract Engine schema change
(new age-boundary columns on ContractTransferOption, re-entering that
data for every contract), regardless of frontend complexity. The
choice to keep one hardcoded boundary set isn't just "simpler for now"
-- it's the only implementable option without that backend work.

Reason: Project owner surfaced this nuance mid-implementation of the
child-age-input search form redesign, specifically flagging that
different services within the same hotel contract could use different
age cutoffs. Rather than silently baking in a possibly-wrong universal
assumption, checked the actual schema first and found the transfer
side has no age-boundary data to fetch dynamically even if desired --
confirming the simple approach isn't a shortcut being taken over a
better available option, but the only option available today.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Logged as a known simplification, not implemented as
per-service dynamic bucketing. Revisit only as a dedicated task that
also adds age-boundary columns to ContractTransferOption (or an
equivalent), scoped separately -- not a frontend-only fix.

# Decision 024

Date: 2026-07-08

Decision: Hotel Engine's validate_capacity (LOCKED, Decision 015) only
checked the coarse sum ceiling (adults + children <= max_occupancy),
which let combinations through that don't match any of a room type's
actual configured RoomOccupancyOption rows -- concretely, Sky Studio's
max_occupancy=4 let "4 adults + 0 children" price and book
successfully, even though the room's only two real configurations are
"2 adults + 2 children" or "3 adults" (not 4). Fixed by adding a second
check: the requested (adults, children) must be dominated by at least
one Active RoomOccupancyOption row for that room type -- adults <=
row.adults AND children <= row.children -- not merely under the sum
ceiling.

Domination, not exact match, is the deliberate semantic: a room
type's configured rows describe maximum configurations ("2A2C or 3A"),
not an exhaustive enumeration of every bookable subset. 2 adults alone,
or 2 adults + 1 child, are legitimate lesser occupancies within the
"2A2C" ceiling and don't need their own row -- exact-match would have
rejected nearly every regression test run all session (every "2 adults"
baseline price check used throughout Decisions 017/021/022 is a subset
of a configured row, never an exact equality to one), which would have
made the fix strictly worse than doing nothing. Room types with zero
configured RoomOccupancyOption rows skip this check entirely and fall
back to the coarse sum-only check -- a room type that hasn't had exact
combinations entered yet shouldn't have every booking rejected,
matching Decision 015's original permissive intent.

A related, separate data correction: Sky Studio's real configured
combinations were mismodeled since Decision 020 -- entered as "2A2C or
4A" (matching a mistranscription in the original room-list table) when
the real Kandima PDF says "2A2C or 3A". This turned out to apply to
all 9 "2A2C or 4A"-pattern room types, not just Sky Studio (Sunrise
Beach Pool Villa with Swirlpool, Sky Studio, Beach Studio, Beach Villa
with Swirlpool, Sunset Beach Pool Villa with Swirlpool, Aqua Villa,
Aqua Villa with Swirlpool, Ocean Pool Villa, Sunset Aqua Pool Suite) --
confirmed by the project owner as a uniform correction, not specific to
Sky Studio. The 10th room type, 2-bedroom Family Sky Suite ("4A4C or
8A"), was already correctly modeled and is unaffected. Each affected
room type's (4 adults, 0 children) RoomOccupancyOption row was updated
to (3 adults, 0 children); the (2 adults, 2 children) row is unchanged.

Reason: Project owner identified the Sky Studio overbooking gap during
manual review, connecting it to the same known limitation flagged
earlier (Sirru Fen Fushi review): RoomOccupancyOption stores real valid
combinations, but validate_capacity never actually checked them,
relying solely on the coarse sum ceiling from Decision 015. Same
category of gap as Decisions 011/015/018/021: a downstream real-data
review revealing a hole in an already-LOCKED Engine's function that a
purely code-level read wouldn't catch alone.

Approved By: Daler

Status: Implemented and verified end-to-end via real HTTP calls.
Bug-fix confirmation: 4 adults + 0 children now correctly rejected for
both Sky Studio and Sunrise Beach Pool Villa with Swirlpool ("exceeds
every configured combination... configured combinations (as ceilings):
2 adults + 2 children, 3 adults + 0 children"). Full regression suite
re-run unchanged: Test Beach Resort 540.0; Kandima BB/HB+/FB+/PAI at
2 adults (1002.0/1182.0/1282.0/1392.0) and BB at 2 adults + 1 child
(1062.0); Sunset Aqua Pool Suite BB/HB+/FB+/PAI (1927.0/2107.0/2207.0/
2317.0); Sunrise Beach Pool Villa at 3 adults still 1192.0 (correctly
dominated by the corrected (3,0) row). Transfer/booking flow re-run
unchanged: Kandima booking without transfer_type still rejected,
with transfer_type=seaplane still succeeds (total_amount=1002.0,
transfer_total=1450.0); Test Beach Resort booking without transfer_type
still succeeds (2 adults + 0 children correctly recognized as a subset
of its configured (2 adults, 1 child) row, not rejected).
